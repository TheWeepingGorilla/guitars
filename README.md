This is an example of an inventory program using a database to store data.

It is simple but functional and could easily be expanded.

Various characteristics that make up a guitar are kept in seperate tables and then aggregiated into
a join table to represent each unique guitar model.

Each characteristic and the guitars themselves can be listed, added, or deleted.
