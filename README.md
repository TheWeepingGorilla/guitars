This is an example of an inventory program using a database to store and retrieve data.

It is simple but functional and demonstrates database concepts. 
It was written in a style that allows expansion.

Various characteristics that make up a guitar are kept in seperate tables and then aggregiated into
a join table to represent each unique guitar model.
Each characteristic and the guitars themselves can be listed, added, or deleted. 

Possible additions: 

Guitar types list themselves in full when added. (Break guitar display code into own function).
Search and return all guitars by manufacturer, body style etc.
Add additional guitar characteristics: model name, color, pickup config etc.
Option to reset numbering in tables to eliminate id sequence gaps.
